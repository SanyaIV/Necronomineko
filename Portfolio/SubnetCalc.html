                <h1 class="display-4">Subnet Calculator - Old</h1>
                <p class="lead">This was the first "real" program I ever made. It was written in C++ during my last year at NTI Upper Secondary Schools of Technology in Stockholm as a final project.</p>
                <p class="lead">It was the first time I really tried learning programming and I learned how to do it on my free time since I was going the network centered program rather than the programming centered program at NTI.</p>
                <p class="lead">At this point I had always wanted to learn programming so I decided to mix that with what I was reading at the time, networking, and since subnetting was such a prevalent part of that program I though it would be a good idea to make a calculator that did the things we otheriwse had to do by hand during several courses.</p>
                <p class="lead">The quality of the code very much reflects being the first program I ever wrote while being pressed for time and learning everything on my own.</p>
                <hr class="my-4">
                <p class="lead"><b>Language:</b> C++</p>
                <p class="lead"><b>Platform:</b> Windows (Console application)</p>
                <p class="lead"><b>Source Control:</b> At the time I knew nothing about source control software, my solution was simply to backup every working .cpp file, sadly those have gone lost now. I have uploaded the last available code to <a href="https://github.com/SanyaIV/SubnetCalcOld">GitHub</a>.</p>

                <h1 class="display-4">Subnet Calculator - New</h1>
                <p class="lead">Of course I've learned quite a lot since then and during my studies at Stockholm University I decided to rewrite my Subnet Calculator from scratch.</p>
                <p class="lead">It's quite an improvement code wise if you ask me. It started out as object-oriented, though I later rewrote it to be more function-oriented simply for the sake of trying it out.</p>
